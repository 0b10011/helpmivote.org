# HelpMIVote.org

[HelpMIVote.org](http://helpmivote.org) is designed to help new and existing Michigan voters with the voting process. The site's code is hosted in this repository.

## Questions and comments

Have a question or comment? Go ahead and send it to <brandon@helpmivote.org>.

## Reporting errors and new features

If you're just looking to report a typo or incorrect information, or have a suggestion for something that could be added to the site, [head on over to the "Issues" section](https://github.com/bfrohs/helpmivote.org/issues) and click "New issue". Then, fill out the "Title" and add a description of your issue or suggestion in the "Leave a comment" box. After you're finished, click "Submit new issue". Keep in mind that issues are *public*. If you want to report an issue or make a suggestion, but don't want it to be public, go ahead and send the issue or suggestion to <brandon@helpmivote.org>.

## Working on the site yourself

The site itself is a Jekyll site, but for the most part, that doesn't matter when it comes to working on the site. If you're just wanting to edit a page, look for the corresponding `.md` file. For example, the "Register to Vote" page is `register-to-vote.md`. These files are in a language called "Markdown" and should be rather easy to edit, even if you've never worked with Markdown before. GitHub has [a helpful guide for getting started with Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to <brandon@helpmivote.org>.

### Work on site on GitHub

Just click "Edit" when viewing a file, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Once again, [GitHub has a guide for this](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

### Work and see site on your computer

If you are comfortable with Git, the command line, and working with source code, you can work on the site on your local machine.

#### Getting development environment set up

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:bfrohs/helpmivote.org.git`
2. Make sure you're [set up to run Jykyll locally](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)

#### Hacking on HelpMIVote.org

From your terminal, `cd` to the `helpmivote.org` directory on your computer and run `jekyll serve`. This will launch the site locally at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/> and automatically update the site on your machine as you save changes to files.
